# Phase Plots
An action potential (AP) phase plot shows membrane voltage (V) on the horizontal axis and its derivative (dV) on the vertical axis. This forms a loop which goes in a clockwise circle once per AP.

## Ramp protocol
A current-clamp protocol which gently increases current injection allows for the most natural APs (and cleanest phase plots)

## Step protocol
Step protocols have slightly less natural APs, but can still be interpreted.
