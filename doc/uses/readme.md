---|---
[Inspect sweeps around tags](tag inspect) from long ABFs. This is intended to facilitate visual inspection of EPSCs and IPSCs. | ![](tag inspect/01.png)
[Calculate the _net effect_ of EPSCs and IPSCs recorded at the same time](EPSCs-and-IPSCs) using voltage clamp recordings at -50mV with low [Cl] to yield traces with EPSC/IPSC deflections in opposite directions. | ![](EPSCs-and-IPSCs/variance method/2016-12-16-tryout-yesSub.png)
[Remove 60 Hz fundamental and harmonic noise](spectral-noise) from poor quality recordings while maintaining sharp resolution of fast transients (like membrane tests, EPSCs, and IPSCs) | ![](spectral-noise/done.png)
