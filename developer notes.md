Either use the update commands from within origin (`sc update`) or update via github desktop client. Don't do both, or the github desktop client will get confused!

### setting up a new system
* absoulte file paths are required for now. Work only in C:\Apps\pythonModules\
* create an EMPTY directory all lowercase: C:\Apps\pythonModules\swhlab
* on the [main github page](https://github.com/swharden/SWHLab), clone this project using the desktop project
* when asked where to save it, set it to C:\Apps\pythonModules\ (NOT the swhlab folder!)

### making changes to the project
* it is recommended that you periodically use the 'sync' button of the desktop client to keep your code current
* when you've made changes you wish to commit, add a brief note as to what you've done, click commit, and you MUST click sync again
