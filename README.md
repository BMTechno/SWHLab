# SWHLab
SWHLab is a python module intended to provide easy access to high level ABF file opeartions to aid analysis of whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings. Although graphs can be interactive, the default mode is to output PNGs and generate flat file HTML indexes to allow data browsing through any browser on the network. Direct ABF access was provided by the  [NeoIO](https://pythonhosted.org/neo/io.html) module.

SWHLab is a collection of tools to provide easy access
to ABF files containing patch-clamp electrophysiology data. NeoIO provides
direct access to ABF data, and SWHLab makes it easy to perform high-level
operations (such as event detection, action potential characterization,
calculation of cell capacitance from voltage clamp or current clamp traces).
SWHLab intended to be used as a tool for neurophysiology data exploration, 
rather than production or presentation. It can be easily incorporated into
other projects where accessing ABF data is desired.
