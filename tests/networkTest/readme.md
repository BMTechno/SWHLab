# X-Drive Stress Test
This script will stress the X-Drive in two ways:
* copying a 500MB file to the local computer
* manually seaching every folder in a large tree
Each will be done 5 times and the result averaged.
* now uses `xcopy` instead of `shutil.copy()`

## Python Solution
Use Python 3 to run the contents of [networkTest.py](networkTest.py)

#### Output
```
walking the entire tree of: X:\Data\DIC2\2014
(1/5) scanned 976 folders in 9.959 seconds
(2/5) scanned 976 folders in 8.234 seconds
(3/5) scanned 976 folders in 6.439 seconds
(4/5) scanned 976 folders in 5.795 seconds
(5/5) scanned 976 folders in 6.651 seconds
Average time for 5 runs: 7.416 seconds

copying a HUGE file: X:\...\2017-05-11 cell3_annotated.tif
(1/5) copy took 11.413 seconds (38.470 MB/s)
(2/5) copy took 12.155 seconds (36.122 MB/s)
(3/5) copy took 15.876 seconds (27.655 MB/s)
(4/5) copy took 25.751 seconds (17.050 MB/s)
(5/5) copy took 24.775 seconds (17.722 MB/s)
Average time for 5 runs: 17.994 seconds

# Powershell Solution
_You have to run the one line in AllowScript, then you can execute bandwidthtest2.ps1 from your computer in the Powershell ISE.  If you want to do this youâ€™d need to change the local path to match something on your computer._

**AllowScript:**
```PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

**networkTest:**
```PowerShell
$SourcePath = "J:\"
$TargetPath = 'C:\Users\cjfraz\Desktop\bench\'
$FileName = "bench2"
$FileSize = (Get-ChildItem $SourcePath\$FileName -ErrorAction Stop).Length
$OutputFile = 'C:\Users\cjfraz\Desktop\bench\out222.txt'
$iNumTrials = 5
$AveDown=$AveUp=0

For ($i=0;$i -lt $iNumTrials-1; $i++){
   $TimeDown = Measure-Command { Copy-Item $SourcePath\$FileName $TargetPath\$FileName }
   $TimeUp = Measure-Command { Copy-Item $TargetPath\$FileName $SourcePath\$FileName }
   $MbpsDown = [Math]::Round((($FileSize * 8) / $TimeDown.TotalSeconds) / 1048576,2)
   $MbpsUp = [Math]::Round((($FileSize * 8) / $TimeUp.TotalSeconds) / 1048576,2)
   Write-Output "$MbpsDown, $MbpsUp"| Out-File $OutputFile -Append
   Write-Output "   MbpsDown: $MbpsDown    MbpsUp: $MbpsUp"
   $AveDown+=$MbpsDown
   $AveUp+=$MbpsUp
}
 $AveDown/=$iNumTrials
 $AveUp/=$iNumTrials
 Write-Output "   AveDown: $AveDown   AveUp: $AveUp"
```
